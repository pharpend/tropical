# Tropical

Tropical numbers are the same as real numbers, except the operations are
different. You can compound these operations, and get tropical vectors,
tropical matrices, etc. This package is a Haskell library dealing with
tropical things.

## Formal definition of tropicality

The tropical semiring is $\{\mathbb{R},\, \infty,\, \oplus,\, \odot\}$.
The scalar operations are defined as such:

$$a \oplus b = min\;\{a,\, b\}$$
$$a \odot b = a + b$$

Note the difference between $+$ and $\oplus$. Also note, since there is
no inverse classical minimum, (classical maximum doesnâ€™t count), you
cannot tropical subtract. There is, however, inverse classical addition,
so you can tropical divide (classical subtract).

When coding, typing $\oplus$ and $\odot$ would require some fancy tricks with
Unicode. Because of this, we denote them `<+>` and `<*>`, respectively.

## Contributing

Anyone who wants to contribute is more than welcome. This library is
BSD-licensed, so you can pretty much do what you want with it.
